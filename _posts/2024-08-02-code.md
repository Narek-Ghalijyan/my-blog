Let's work through some problems that involve binary code. These problems often relate to binary numbers, binary arithmetic, and encoding/decoding information. I'll present a few problems, explain the solutions, and provide the necessary code.

Problem 1: Binary Representation of a Decimal Number
Problem Description:
Given a non-negative integer, convert it into its binary representation.

Solution Approach:
To convert a decimal number to binary, we can repeatedly divide the number by 2 and keep track of the remainders. The binary representation is the sequence of remainders read in reverse order.

Python Code:

python
Копировать код
def decimal_to_binary(n):
    if n == 0:
        return "0"
    binary_rep = ""
    while n > 0:
        binary_rep = str(n % 2) + binary_rep
        n = n // 2
    return binary_rep

# Example usage
decimal_number = 23
binary_representation = decimal_to_binary(decimal_number)
print(f"Binary representation of {decimal_number} is {binary_representation}")
Output:

Binary representation of 23 is 10111
Problem 2: Counting 1's in Binary Representation
Problem Description:
Given a non-negative integer, count the number of 1's in its binary representation.

Solution Approach:
Once the number is converted to binary, we can count the number of '1' characters in the string representation.

Python Code:

python
Копировать код
def count_ones_in_binary(n):
    return bin(n).count('1')

# Example usage
decimal_number = 23
ones_count = count_ones_in_binary(decimal_number)
print(f"Number of 1's in binary representation of {decimal_number} is {ones_count}")
Output:

vbnet

Number of 1's in binary representation of 23 is 4
Problem 3: Binary Addition
Problem Description:
Given two binary strings, return their sum as a binary string.

Solution Approach:
Binary addition can be done similarly to decimal addition. Start from the rightmost bit, add corresponding bits along with any carry, and keep track of the carry.

Python Code:

python
Копировать код
def binary_addition(bin1, bin2):
    max_len = max(len(bin1), len(bin2))
    
    # Pad the shorter string with zeros
    bin1 = bin1.zfill(max_len)
    bin2 = bin2.zfill(max_len)
    
    result = ''
    carry = 0
    
    # Traverse the binary strings from right to left
    for i in range(max_len - 1, -1, -1):
        sum_ = carry
        sum_ += 1 if bin1[i] == '1' else 0
        sum_ += 1 if bin2[i] == '1' else 0
        result = ('1' if sum_ % 2 == 1 else '0') + result
        carry = 0 if sum_ < 2 else 1
    
    if carry != 0:
        result = '1' + result
    
    return result

# Example usage
binary1 = "1101"
binary2 = "1011"
sum_binary = binary_addition(binary1, binary2)
print(f"Sum of {binary1} and {binary2} is {sum_binary}")
Output:

yaml

Sum of 1101 and 1011 is 11000
Problem 4: Convert Binary to Decimal
Problem Description:
Given a binary string, convert it to its decimal equivalent.

Solution Approach:
To convert a binary string to a decimal number, start from the rightmost bit, and for each bit, calculate the corresponding power of 2 and sum them up.

Python Code:

python
Копировать код
def binary_to_decimal(binary_str):
    decimal_value = 0
    for i, digit in enumerate(reversed(binary_str)):
        if digit == '1':
            decimal_value += 2 ** i
    return decimal_value

# Example usage
binary_string = "1101"
decimal_value = binary_to_decimal(binary_string)
print(f"Decimal value of binary string {binary_string} is {decimal_value}")
Output:

vbnet

Decimal value of binary string 1101 is 13
Problem 5: Checking if a Number is a Power of Two
Problem Description:
Given a positive integer, determine if it is a power of two.

Solution Approach:
A number is a power of two if it has exactly one '1' in its binary representation. We can use the property 
�
&
(
�
−
1
)
=
=
0
n&(n−1)==0 to check this, where 
&
& is the bitwise AND operation.

Python Code:

python
Копировать код
def is_power_of_two(n):
    if n <= 0:
        return False
    return (n & (n - 1)) == 0

# Example usage
number = 16
power_of_two = is_power_of_two(number)
print(f"{number} is a power of two: {power_of_two}")
Output:

python
Копировать код
16 is a power of two: True
