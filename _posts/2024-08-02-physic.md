 Let's work on some 8th-grade physics problems that are common in a specialized physics-mathematics (phys-math) curriculum. These problems will involve fundamental physics concepts such as mechanics, electricity, and basic thermodynamics. I'll present a few problems along with their solutions.

Problem 1: Newton's Second Law of Motion
Problem Description:
A 5 kg object is subjected to a force of 20 N. What is the acceleration of the object?

Solution Approach:
Newton's Second Law states that the acceleration 
�
a of an object is directly proportional to the net force 
�
F acting on it and inversely proportional to its mass 
�
m:

�
=
�
�
F=ma
To find the acceleration, we rearrange the formula:

�
=

Problem 2: Work, Energy, and Power
Problem Description:
A person lifts a 10 kg box to a height of 2 meters. Calculate the work done by the person against gravity.

Solution Approach:
Work done against gravity is calculated using the formula:

�
=
�
⋅
�
W=F⋅d
where 
�
F is the force and 
�
d is the displacement. The force in this case is the weight of the box, which can be calculated as:

�

F=mg

Problem 3: Ohm's Law and Electrical Circuits
Problem Description:
In an electrical circuit, a resistor with a resistance of 10 ohms is connected across a 5V battery. Calculate the current flowing through the resistor.

Solution Approach:
Ohm's Law states that the current 
�
I flowing through a conductor between two points is directly proportional to the voltage 
�
V across the two points and inversely proportional to the resistance 
�
R of the conductor:

�
=

�
V=IR
To find the current, we rearrange the formula:

Answer:
The current flowing through the resistor is 0.5 Amperes.

Problem 4: Kinematics - Free Fall
Problem Description:
An object is dropped from a height of 20 meters. How long does it take to reach the ground? (Ignore air resistance.)

Solution Approach:
For an object in free fall, the distance

Problem 5: Heat and Temperature - Specific Heat Capacity

How much heat energy is required to raise the temperature of 2 kg of water from 20°C to 100°C? (The specific heat capacity of water is 
4200
 J/kg
