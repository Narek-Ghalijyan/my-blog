Let's tackle some 8th-grade level math problems, particularly focusing on problems that might be encountered in a specialized physics-mathematics (phys-math) curriculum. These problems often combine mathematical reasoning with basic physics concepts. I'll present a few problems and walk through the solutions.

Problem 1: Distance, Speed, and Time
Problem Description:
A car travels from City A to City B at a constant speed of 60 km/h. On the return trip from City B to City A, the car travels at a speed of 80 km/h. If the total travel time is 3.5 hours, find the distance between City A and City B.

Solution Approach:
Let 
�
d be the distance between City A and City B.

Time for the first trip (A to B):
�
1
=
�
60
 hours
t 
1
​
 =

=
3.5
 hours
t

Answer:
The distance between City A and City B is 120 km.

Problem 2: Work and Power
Problem Description:
A student lifts a 5 kg textbook from the floor to a shelf 1.5 meters above the ground in 2 seconds. Calculate the work done and the power used in this process.

Solution Approach:

Work Done (W):
Work is calculated as the product of the force applied and the distance over which the force is applied. The force here is the weight of the textbook

Certainly! Let's dive into some classic 8th-grade math problems that are common in a specialized physics-mathematics (phys-math) curriculum. These problems often involve a combination of algebra, geometry, and basic physics concepts.

Problem 1: Solving Systems of Equations
Problem Description:
Two numbers have a sum of 20, and their difference is 4. Find the numbers.

Solution Approach:
Let 
�
x and 
�
y be the two numbers. We have the following system of equations:

�
+
�
=
20
x+y=20

�
−
�
=
4
x−y=4
Solving the system:

Add the two equations to eliminate 
�
y:
(
�
+
�
)
+
(
�
−
�
)
=
20
+
4
(x+y)+(x−y)=20+4

2
�
=

2x=24

�
=
12
x=12
Substitute 
�
x back into the first equation to find 
�
y:
12
+
�
=
20
12+y=20

�
=
8
y=8
Answer:
The two numbers are 12 and 8.

Problem 2: Geometry - Area and Perimeter
Problem Description:
A rectangle has a length that is twice its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 36 cm, find the dimensions of the rectangle.

Solution Approach:
Let 
�
w be the width of the rectangle. Then the length 
�
l is 
2
�
2w. The perimeter 
�
P of a rectangle is given by:

�
=
2
�
+
2
�
P=2l+2w
Given 
�
=
36
P=36:

2
(
2
�
)
+
2
�
=
36
2(2w)+2w=36
Solving the equation:

2
�
=
36
4w+2w=36

6
�
=
36
6w=36

�
=
6
w=6
Now, find the length 
�
l:

�
=
2
�

)
=
12
l=2w=2(6)=12
Answer:
The width of the rectangle is 6 cm, and the length is 12 cm.

Problem 4: Pythagorean Theorem
Problem Description:
A ladder 13 meters long leans against a wall. The bottom of the ladder is 5 meters away from the wall. How high up the wall does the ladder reach?

Solution Approach:
This problem involves a right triangle, where the ladder forms the hypotenuse, the distance from the wall to the bottom of the ladder forms one leg, and the height the ladder reaches forms the other leg.

Let 
ℎ
h be the height the ladder reaches. Using the Pythagorean theorem:
