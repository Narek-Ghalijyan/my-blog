Let's explore some 9th-grade level mathematics problems, particularly focusing on those that are common in a physics-mathematics (phys-math) curriculum. These problems will often involve algebra, geometry, and basic physics concepts.

Problem 1: Quadratic Equations

Problem 2: Geometry - Circles and Tangents
Problem Description:
A line is tangent to a circle with a radius of 5 cm at a point 12 cm away from the center of the circle. Find the distance from the center of the circle to the point where the tangent line touches the circle.

Solution Approach:
For a line tangent to a circle, the radius to the point of tangency is perpendicular to the tangent line. The problem forms a right triangle where:

One leg is the radius of the circle, 
�
=
5
r=5 cm.
The hypotenuse is the distance from the circle's center to the point where the line touches the circle, which we'll call 
�
d.
The other leg is the distance from the circle's center to the tangent point along the line, 
�
=
12
c=12 cm.
By the Pythagorean theorem:

d=13
Answer:
The distance from the center of the circle to the point where the tangent line touches the circle is 13 cm.

Problem 3: Trigonometry - Solving a Triangle
Problem Description:
In a right triangle, one of the angles is 30°, and the hypotenuse is 10 cm. Find the lengths of the other two sides.

Solution Approach:
In a right triangle:

The side opposite the 30° angle (let's call it 
�
a) is half the hypotenuse.
The other side (let's call it 
�
b) can be found using the Pythagorean theorem.
Solution:

Problem 4: Physics - Kinematics
Problem Description:
A car accelerates uniformly from rest to a speed of 20 m/s over a distance of 200 m. Determine the acceleration and the time taken to reach this speed.
